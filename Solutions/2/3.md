```
*Main> lastButOne [1..100]
99
*Main> lastButOne [1,2]
1
*Main> lastButOne [1]
*** Exception: Prelude.last: empty list
*Main> lastButOne []
*** Exception: Prelude.init: empty list
*Main>
```

It throws an empty list exception which make sense, because there can't be a previous element to the last one if there's less than two elements.
